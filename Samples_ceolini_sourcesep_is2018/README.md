Examples of separated audio for each of the methods presented in the paper.
The examples have been taken from the speakers in position 4 and 7 respectively (see figure of the setup in the paper).

The names are self explainatory, we have the separation obtained with classical LCMV (emp_lim) and those obtained with each of the 3 methods: GCC, MNICA and SPS.
